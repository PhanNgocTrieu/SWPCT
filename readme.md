	Tactic:
	There are 3 problems on test (pre-test and real test):
	Problem 1: Easy (30)
	Problem 2: Medium (30)
	Problem 3: Hard (40)
	Need to get 70 points
	=> Basic tactic: solve full Problem 1, problem 2 and a part of problem 3. Sometimes, it's better to solve problem 1 and 3 only.
	How to solve a problem:
		Make sure we understand problem correctly!!!
		Each problem has TCs. Higher passed TCs, higher point
		Good logic
		Satisfy time and memory => Need understand about Time complexity & Memory complexity.
	Example:
	https://codepro.lge.com/exam/19/overseas-questions-for-previous-test/quiz/1
	https://codepro.lge.com/exam/19/overseas-questions-for-previous-test/quiz/2
	Good resources to practice:
	codepro.lge.com (pass: lset2022)
	leetcode.com
	
	Tips to remember:
		library all-in-one: bits/stdc++.h
		how to use sort()
		Understand much about BFS
		how to use next_permutation() to generate all permutations
		how to generate all subsets of a set
		Understand about bitwise
		Know how to implementation backtracking
